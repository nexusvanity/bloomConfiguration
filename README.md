# Hi, I'm Bloom.
I program freely, do what I want, because why not? Life is the shortest thing and the longest thing, So I just do want I want.
Besides, the Latin term, _"Memento Mori"_ refers to that, We all will die, so why not make the best?


For me, that''s programming.

I'm eighteen, a Canadian scripter and a writer. I  mainly code on C++ and bat, but I know some Python too. I also know HTML and CSS. A master...in terms of UI.
